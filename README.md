# ChessGame
Simple top down, 2D Chess Game
This game doesn't support any fancy chess moves, just normal moving and killing AKA chess for non-chess experts
The king has to be actually killed for the game to end
disclaimer: the optimization is pretty bad, but it doesnt really slow down the game or cause any delayed play so meh..
