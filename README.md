Simple top down, 2D Chess Game.

This game doesn't support any fancy chess moves, just normal moving and killing AKA chess for non-chess experts.

DESCRIPTION AND FEATURES
------------------------
This is a chess game developed using Java programming language.
The game allows two users to take turns into playing on a chess board; one player uses the black pieces and the other uses the white pieces.
 
The player who chooses white piece has to start by playing the first turn.

To end the current game, the king has to be actually killed by an enemy piece
and not just surrounded by enemy pieces to give a sense of realism to the players.

TILE COLOR INDICATION
---------------------
-Tile color changes to yellow to show the player's current piece. The player
chooses a current piece by clicking on it.

-Tile color changes to green to show the player their current possible moves
for the current piece.

-Tile color changes to red when a piece is in a vulnerable position and
can be killed by an enemy piece.

-Tile color changes to blue if the blue colored tile is a position to where
if the king moves it will most likely be killed; (the tile of piece that 
might kill the king will change to red)

disclaimer: the optimization is pretty bad, but it doesnt really slow down the game or cause any delayed play so meh..
