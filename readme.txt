DESCRIPTION AND FEATURES
------------------------
This is a chess game developed using Java programming language.
The game allows two users to take turns into playing on a chess board; one player uses the black pieces and the other uses the white pieces.
 
The player who chooses white piece has to start by playing the first turn.

To end the current game, the king has to be actually killed by an enemy piece
and not just surrounded by enemy pieces to give a sense of realism to the players.

if the king moves it will most likely be killed; (the tile of piece that
